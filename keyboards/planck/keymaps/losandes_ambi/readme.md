# Losandes Ambi Planck Layout

This layout is designed to be fairly similar to a standard qwerty layout for the primary layer, but with substantial differences to other layers. Most noteably, the numbers are in a numpad layout, and the special characters are mostly shifted to the left hand, with some exceptions. Navigation on the primary layer is optimized for left, and right movements, using my thumb, and in a secondary layer, I use a right handed wasd style layout: `okl;`.
