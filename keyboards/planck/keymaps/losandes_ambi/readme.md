# Losandes Ambi Planck Layout

This layout is designed to be fairly similar to a standard qwerty layout for the primary layer, but with substantial differences to other layers. Most noteably, the numbers are in a numpad layout, and the special characters are mostly shifted to the left hand, with some exceptions.
