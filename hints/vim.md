## Editor Commands
Vim is an editor to create or edit a text file. There are two modes in vim. One is the command mode and another is the insert mode. In the command mode, user can move around the file, delete text, etc. In the insert mode, user can insert text.

### Changing mode from one to another
* From command mode to insert mode, type `a/A/i/I/o/O` (see details below).
* From insert mode to command mode, type `Esc` (escape key)

## My Common Keystrokes
